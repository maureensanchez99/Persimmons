# Persimmons  
This project first started out as a mini project for a part of MLh LHD:Learn daily challenges but I decided to keep going with creating this basic website. I first started out with the idea of doing a single static page about persimmons with an animated background. Then I decided to build on that and make it into a sort of mini-blog site dedicated to persimmons.  

## Update - 10/12/24
I started updating this page again because I want to show my Lilong something that I've created that was inspired by him. I have some features in mind as well want to implement a backend to create a storage of the images but we'll see eventually what I end up completing.
