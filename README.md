# Persimmons  

This project first started out as a mini project for a part of MLh LHD:Learn daily challenges but I decided to keep going with creating this basic website  

I first started out with the idea of doing a single static page about persimmons with an animated background. Then I decided to build on that and make it into a sort of mini-blog site dedicated to persimmons.
